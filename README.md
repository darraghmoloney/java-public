Programming projects in Java

Some of the programming projects I've completed in Java, based on both course-work, online challenges and own ideas.

DigitalClock.java -> A program to print out a series of numbers in a "digital" number style, but with the numbers all on one line.

LuhnsV2.java -> A program to check if a credit-card or other number is valid using the Luhn's Algorithm check with the right-most digit being a check number and even digits after that being doubled, etc.

Tower.java -> A program to check the minimum height of a tower of objects so that the tower has a certain overhang, where the objects are stacked on top of each other in order to lean over a table or other surface.
