Programming projects in Java

Some of the programming projects I've completed in Java, based on both course-work, online challenges and own ideas.

<strong>DigitalClock.java</strong> -> A program to print out a series of numbers in a "digital" number style, but with the numbers all on one line.

<strong>DirectionStack.java</strong> -> This program takes in a series of directions, adds them to a homemade stack, pops them off the stack and reverses them to give you the directions to get back home. It also has a "Go back" instruction which makes the last direction be ignored.

<strong>EuclidGCD.java</strong> -> Uses a recursive method to find the Greatest Common Denominator of an array of numbers, calculated with Euclid's algorithm.

<strong>LuhnsV2.java</strong> -> A program to check if a credit-card or other number is valid using the Luhn's Algorithm check with the right-most digit being a check number and even digits after that being doubled, etc.

<strong>MonteSpag.java</strong> -> Using the Monte Carlo simulation to determine how many valid triangles can be created, given a piece of spaghetti which is broken into 3 pieces in 2 random places, and which the longest piece can have a certain percent of it nibbled off.

<strong>PrimeIt.java</strong> -> Prints primes within a given range of numbers.

<strong>Tower2.java</strong> -> A program to check the minimum height of a tower of objects so that the tower has a certain overhang, where the objects are stacked on top of each other in order to lean over a table or other surface.
