Programming projects in Java

Some of the programming projects I've completed in Java, based on both course-work, online challenges and own ideas.

---
## DFS Tracking
Using a depth-first search to find the length of all possible paths that can be explored and return the longest ones.

## Dijkstra
Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

## GPS Distance
Investigating a "Travelling Salesperson" problem using a mixture of Monte Carlo randomization & 2-Opt singles / pairs.

## Hangman AI
Using statistics to guess randomly chosen dictionary words.

## Krusky
Getting the Minimal-Spanning Tree of a group of Edges using Kruskal's Algorithm.

## Maze Solver
Using a depth-first search to find a maze exit.

## Primm
Implementation of the Primm-Jarnik Minimal-Spanning Tree algorithm.

## Snakey
A quick-and-dirty console implementation of Snake game logic.

## DigitalClock.java
A program to print out a series of numbers in a "digital" number style, but with the numbers all on one line.

## DirectionStack.java
This program takes in a series of directions, adds them to a homemade stack, pops them off the stack and reverses them to give you the directions to get back home. It also has a "Go back" instruction which makes the last direction be ignored.

## EuclidGCD.java
Uses the recursive method to find the Greatest Common Denominator of an array of numbers, calculated with Euclid's algorithm.

## LuhnsV2.java
A program to check if a credit-card or other number is valid using the Luhn's Algorithm check with the right-most digit being a check number and even digits after that being doubled, etc.

## MonteSpag.java
Using the Monte Carlo simulation to determine how many valid triangles can be created, given a piece of spaghetti which is broken into 3 pieces in 2 random places, and which the longest piece can have a certain percent of it nibbled off.

## PrimeIt.java
Prints primes within a given range of numbers.

## Tower2.java
A program to check the minimum height of a tower of objects so that the tower has a certain overhang, where the objects are stacked on top of each other in order to lean over a table or other surface.
